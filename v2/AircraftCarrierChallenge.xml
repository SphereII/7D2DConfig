				A mini overhaul mod for Release Ver. 2.1(b5)
				
				This mod pack was created for a solo or multiplayer challenge onboard a US Ford class carrier by_NAZ redesigned by Devilskut for Release Ver. 2.1(b5) with code help from Techgeek_20 
				and "bug  hunting" from AngelacusGaming.

				Notes about this mini-mod:

				Zombie corpses now drop an entity-specific red loot bag.
				Removed non-essential vehicle parts from loot and crafting.
				Beds, Bedrolls, and land claim block recipes removed.
				Removed treasure maps from loot.
				Acid can now be made in the campfire, but a beaker is a required tool. Can also be crafted cheaper in the chem station. Unlocked with Grease Monkey 4.
				Mod-specific loading screen tips.
				Localization tweaks (names of those that have tested and completed the challenge).
				Perk books can now drop from zombies along with magazines. The chance of a perk book increases with the relevant perk points spent, just like skill magazines.
				Loot tables adjusted accordingly, so certain zombies have a chance to drop certain perk books, just like skill magazines.
				Removed Better Barter, Daring Adventurer and Charismatic Nature from the intellect skill tree.
				Number of Dukes/old cash from Businessman/Party Girl is increased, probability increased from 10% to 20%.
				Slight increase in oil shale from cement mixer loot.
				Increased chance of antibiotics from nurses per perk point spent in Physician, up to a max chance of 35%.
				Base chance of skill magazines from radiated zombies increased from 10% to 13%.
				Changed the quest requirements for gathering UH-60 parts to reflect maxed-out Grease Monkey (removed a possible soft-lock)
				Antibiotics loot probability from nurses now tied to Physician perk.
				Player placed workstations can be picked up with no need for a land claim block. (Workstation MUST be empty of all tools, items, and materials for this to work)

				THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER CHALLENGE:
				Can you survive and escape the Aircraft Carrier, using nothing but what you can scavenge from the carrier itself?
				You have one life, one mission, one means of escape.

				This challenge places you, a lone hard core survivor, or a group of survivalists, in a menacing aircraft carrier of death incarnate.

				Your only means of escape is to gather everything you need to be able to craft an UH-60 Helicopter to complete your final mission and to reach your settlement.

				A mini overhaul mod for V2.1(b5). Designed for group or solo play on a AIRCRAFT CARRIER with traders and only one means of escape.

				Five (5) custom worlds, one for each biome, so you can choose your starting "difficulty" - Forest, Burnt, Desert, Snow, or the ultimate challenge, Wasteland.

				Custom-edited Aircraft Carrier POI, giving you everything you need to be able to complete your quests.

				Custom questline, guiding you on your way.

				Custom HUD, and in-game options added for toggling crosshair visibility, health bar visibility, etc.
				Pause the game, and look for "Video", then the "Customize" tab.

				CHALLENGE RULES:

				1: You must stay on the aircraft carrier until you build your helicopter.

				2: The rubble on the ground around the carrier is NOT part of the aircraft carrier, and as such may NOT be used to support any structures, or to grow any crops, 
                   unless you can do this WITHOUT touching it.

				3: You may build bridges off the side of the carrier to reach things, but those bridges must support themselves and cannot touch the ground.

				4: You may NOT mine or dig under the carrier.

				5: All default game settings, unless you want to turn up the size of the hordes. It's recommended to have loot respawn set to 7 days and turn airdrops OFF.

				6: If you die, the game is over.

				7: You must survive until you are able to build an AH-64 Apache Helicopter and complete your final mission and reach your settlement.
