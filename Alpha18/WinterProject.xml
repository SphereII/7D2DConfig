Welcome to the Winter Project 2019 by sphereii and xyth

After many delays, the Winter Project 2019 arrived just in time to be fashionably late. 

Enter in our cold and unforgiving world buried under a snow apocalypse. Find new challenges as you explore the desolate icy wasteland.

In order to generate the world properly, please use the pre-generated worlds:

	Winter Project 4K
	Winter Project 6K
	Winter Project 8K
		

Thank you to the following Modlet creators who helped shape out the world with their modlets:
	Donovan's Better Bridges, Better Spears, Craft Jail and Craft Spikes modlets.
	TormentedEmu's GUI Manager for Localization support for A18.2
	JaxTeller718 for his Charcola, Eggs in Fridges, More Feathers, Working Stoves and Zombie Hand Adjustments
	Mean Cloud's Scrap Bone Knives
	Atlas' More Vanilla Food
	Oignon's Vehicles Pack, Sittable Furniture
	bdubyah's Rebar Club, and Wasteland Weapons
	Stallionsden's Lootable Objects, Store Shelves, and his prots of Valmar's Expanded ammo types and cooking bowls
	War2zuk's Disassemble Ammo

Special thanks goes to Mumpfy for his texturing work.
