 This is something I made mostly for myself, but a few of my friends seem to be enjoying it. As such, I thought I'd open it up to the community. This should be considered beta software AT BEST, so please bear that in mind!

Features.

9 Classes to choose from, with 6 quests each! (Class quests take approx 60 mins to finish if you grind hard)
Skill points per level decreased to 5.
35 slot minibike storage!
10 slot crafting queue!
SimpleUI added! Temperature, food and water displayed on the HUD for your convenience. XP Bar above your hotbar.
